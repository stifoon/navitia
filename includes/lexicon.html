<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The world of public transportation is really specific, you will see here a small
introduction to it. A lot of people in the world of public transportation use
different words to speak about the same thing. Here are the definitions of terms
employed in www.navitia.io</p>

<p>You can read a mobility lexicon at
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTransport/vocabulary/blob/master/vocabulary.md">https://github.com/OpenTransport/vocabulary/blob/master/vocabulary.md</a></p>

<p>You will often read &ldquo;PT&rdquo; in this document. PT stands for public transport.</p>

<h2 id="stop-point">Stop Point</h2>

<p>A stop point is the physical object were someone waits for his bus
(subway, or whatever type of vehicle you can have in a public transport system).</p>

<h2 id="stop-area">Stop Area</h2>

<p>A stop area is a collection of stop points. Generally there are at least two stop
points per stop area, one per direction of a line. Now think of a hub, you will
have more than one line. Therefore your stop area will contain more than two stop
points. In particular cases your stop area can contain only one stop point.</p>

<p>Some datasets do not contain any stop area.</p>

<h2 id="connection">Connection</h2>

<p>This object links two stop points together (named origin and
destination). It is the walkable part of a journey.</p>

<h2 id="journey-pattern">Journey Pattern</h2>

<p>A journey pattern is an ordered list of stop points. Two vehicles that serve exactly the
same stop points in exactly the same order belong to to the same journey pattern.</p>

<h2 id="route">Route</h2>

<p>A route is a collection of journey pattern that match the same commercial direction.</p>

<aside class="warning">
    The GTFS specification uses the term <b>route</b> for the object we call <b>line</b>. It does not
    have this notion of commercial direction.
</aside>

<h2 id="line">Line</h2>

<p>A line is a collection of routes. Most of the time you&rsquo;ll just have just two routes.
This object is called <em>route</em> in the GTFS format.</p>

<h2 id="stop-time">Stop Time</h2>

<p>A stop time represents the time when a bus is planned to arrive and to leave a
stop point.</p>
